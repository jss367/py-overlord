# Iron Barbarian Board Assessment

All components required by `boards/iron_barbarian.txt` are now implemented in the engine.

- The action cards Bridge, Ironmonger, Marauder, Mill, Barbarian, Council Room, Giant, Tragic Hero, and Nobles are available and
  registered with the card registry.
- The board file uses the canonical spellings so that supply piles can be located correctly.
- The Innovation project is implemented and registered, allowing the board to attach the project effect at game start.

With these pieces in place the Iron Barbarian kingdom can be loaded for simulations.
